## Bug

## Solution

The `SomeComponentSolution.js` file shows how to resolve the issue, addressing potential specificity conflicts and ensuring proper Tailwind configuration. The solutions presented might include using more specific class names, overriding styles, or ensuring the Tailwind directives are correct in the project.
